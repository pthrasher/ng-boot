Thrash's ng-boot
================

A super-simple, very minimalist boilerplate for playing around with angular.

Getting Started
---------------


```
git clone https://github.com/pthrasher/ng-boot.git
cd ng-boot
npm i -g grunt-cli
npm i
grunt watch
```


What's included?
----------------

**Grunt Workflow**


* Simple dev-server (grunt-contrib-connect)
* File watching
* Less compilation
* CoffeeScript compilation


**Third Party Libs:**


* jQuery 2.0.3
* Underscore 1.5.1
* jQueryUI 1.10.3 (off by default)
* jQueryUI Bootstrap Theme 0.5 (off by default)
* Twitter Bootstrap (off by default)
* Angular 1.0.7
* Angular 1.1.5 (off by default)


*off by default simply means that it is commented out in the html -- very
simple to add back in if you'd like to. ;-)*


Why?
----


Because I didn't like the other ones out there. Really, this is a local
alternative to jsfiddle. It's often very hard to debug jsfiddle, and you can't
do separate partials as html files in jsfiddle.


What about testing?
-------------------


I accept pull requests. I didn't put this in, because when I'm playing around
with new ideas, I usually do not write tests.

I'm not opposed to having karma added in here, I just want this to remain as
minimal, and friction-free as possible.
