Really, this is a local\r\nalternative to jsfiddle. It's often very hard to debug jsfiddle, and you can't\r\ndo separate partials as html files in jsfiddle.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about testing?\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nI accept pull requests. I didn't put this in, because when I'm playing around\r\nwith new ideas, I usually do not write tests.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to having karma added in here, I just want this to remain as\r\nminimal, and friction-free as possible.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
